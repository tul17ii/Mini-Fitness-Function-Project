Crop Optimization using Genetic Algorithm

This project applies a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize crop selection and farming strategies based on multiple fitness functions. Users can choose between three options:

Crop Yield Fitness – maximizing productivity.

Environmental Impact Fitness – minimizing harmful effects.

Combined Fitness – balancing yield and sustainability.
